# Project Overview
Canteen App provides a seamless way for both students and staff to order food from the convenience of their devices, without having to physically wait in line. By allowing users to browse a live menu, add their favorite items to a cart, reserve meals in advance, and make secure online payments, the app is beneficial in cutting down on waiting times especially during busy hours.
